# Raspberry-Touchscreen-Brightness-Buttons
Desktop "buttons" for easy, one-touch adjustment of backlight brightness

Adjusting brightness by typing into the Terminal quickly became a chore -- Especially with a small virtual keyboard.
XFCE Power Manager has a nice slider control, but access via the Notification Area is fidgety on such a small display.
Here's my favorite solution, to date:

1.  Drop the Lightbulbs folder into /usr/share/icons.
2.  Drop the .desktop files into /usr/share/applications.
3.  Five brightness options will appear on the Settings menu.
4.  Optionally, drop a couple of the .desktop files onto the Desktop for instant access (/home/<<user>>/Desktop).
